# evolforRces

Population genetics simulations for students to learn about **evol**utionary **foRces**. Consistent with CRAN Law, this package has a capital R in its name.


This Shiny application (inspired by CJ Battey's [driftr Shiny app](https://github.com/cjbattey/driftR)) allows users to visualize how evolutionary forces affect i) allele frequencies and b) population fitness over time.

Please direct all questions/requests to the Issues section of this repo. Note, this shiny app is designed for classroom use and is **not meant to be comprehensive**; many feature requests may therefore be beyond the scope of this project. That said, fork away as needed!
