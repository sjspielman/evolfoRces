# driftr-lite

Simulate population genetics simulations for the classroom

This Shiny application, inspired by CJ Battey's [driftr Shiny app](https://github.com/cjbattey/driftR"),". The purpose of this program is to visualize how evolutionary forces affect i) allele frequencies and b) population fitness over time.

Please direct all questions/requests to the Issues section of this repo. Note, this shiny app is designed for classroom use and is not meant to be comprehensive; many feature requests may therefore be beyond the scope of this project. That said, fork away as needed!
